Key Points:

Importance of Data Architecture:

Data architecture is a critical enabler in the NYP Data Management Framework, aligning with NYP's Vision and Mission. It plays a crucial role in representing core business processes where data is collected, processed, used, and stored.
Alignment with NYP Vision and Mission:

Data architecture must support NYP's goals by ensuring clear and consistent data definitions across all communication channels and platforms, facilitating a common vocabulary in discussions.
Model Structure:

The TOGAF definition of data architecture is adopted, viewing it as composed of models, policies, rules, or standards governing data collection, storage, integration, and usage.
A 4-level hierarchical Categorical Model is used:
Subject Area: Core data of the organization.
Aspect: Perspectives or views of functional areas within each subject area.
Category: The actual data object in the model.
Sub-category: Attributes of the data object.
Levels 1 and 2 are used for strategic discussions, while levels 3 and 4 are essential for technical implementation.
Conceptual/Logical Model Overview:

The conceptual model, particularly the "Learner" Subject Area, is highlighted, showing the overall structure and hierarchical expansion.
Modelling Process:

A collaborative process involving data modelling teams, data stewards, subject matter experts, and management to develop, fine-tune, and endorse data models.
The process is designed to ensure the model's acceptance and alignment with organizational goals.
Developed Data Models:

Work has been done on data models for the following areas:
HR
